  but since going vegan you haven't been able to find your fix. Look no further than
  this recipe. Trick your non-vegan friends and your picky children all while creating a

  <h2> Ingredients </h2>




<p> These ingredients are all vegan friendly! Feel free to use regular chocolate chips,
  dark chocolate or even white chocolate. You can also use almond or soy milk. If you
  aren't vegan feel free to use regular milk as well! While this recipe is for dessert, some
  of the ingredients make it (a little) more healthy, so there's less guilt when eating
  just one more.
